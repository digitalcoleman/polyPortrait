# polyPortrait
An example file for blender and instructions for making polygon style portraits from 3D scans.


Introduction:
The following instructions explain how to create portraits using 3D scanning and Blender 3D. The portraits are unique because while the 3D scanning captures an individual over a particular series of moments in time, the decimation process then reduces the millions of data points into a simplified and barely recognizable figure, but one that is still different from every other. The polygonal and flat shading style recommended in the tutorial was a popular aesthetic in the period between 2014-2015.
